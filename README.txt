To start the project open DAD.sln in Visual Studio and press F5

Configuration files are located in ./TestingConsoleApplication/Scripts/*
(both 3.txt and dadstorm.config should work as expected)

Input files for the operators are located in ./TestingConsoleApplication/bin/Debug/Scripts/*

As it stands the project is missing the fault-tolerance mechanisms and the
semantics other than "at-most-once".
